- After you run it from the command line it will ask you a series of questions. First, to enter your username and your monthly earnings. It will then ask if you would like to add an expense and if so, the expense amount. It will continue asking if you would like to add an expense until you type no. After you have implimented your expenses it will display a users name, monthly earnings, expenses(by category), and lastly the remaining balance. The output is all calculated by a users input.
